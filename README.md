**Not Finished; WIP**

This is a small project that utilizes CSharp and the .NET library (7.0). This program allows you to establish multiple web sockets at once (client -> server and server -> client both supported). This is intended to run on Linux-based operating systems that support .NET 7.0 (e.g. using the `dotnet` package).

I made this project to learn more about web sockets in CSharp along with how to manage multiple web sockets receiving/sending data concurrently via asynchronous methods.

More details will come out when the project is finished.
